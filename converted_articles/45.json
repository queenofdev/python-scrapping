    "content": "The utilization of joke cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) continues to expand two years following the COVID-19 pandemic, during which individuals allegedly sought amusement by investing millions in non-serious digital assets. As per data monitored by IntoTheBlock, the number of DOGE cryptocurrency addresses now exceeds 5 million for the first time. Moreover, the amount of active addresses on the network has more than doubled to 168,000, reaching the highest level since March 2022. In addition, the number of confirmed transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain has surged to the highest level since June, with a 1,000% increase in the past 10 days. However, the concentration of DOGE ownership poses a concern, with less than 5,000 addresses controlling over 80% of its supply, giving a select few traders significant influence over its price. The market capitalization of DOGE has climbed by 14% to nearly $11 billion this month, as increased adoption and usage of cryptocurrency often leads to higher market value. Dogecoin gained fame in early 2021 after Elon Musk shared memes related to the coin, leading to the creation of other dog-themed tokens like Shiba Inu. During that period, joke cryptocurrencies experienced a surge in popularity due to factors such as the lockdown, government stimulus checks, and central banks' unconventional monetary policies, which resulted in increased risk-taking in financial markets.",
