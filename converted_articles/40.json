    "content": "Crypto lender BlockFi has filed for bankruptcy protection after suffering significant losses due to the collapse of FTX. The bankruptcy filings reveal that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. BlockFi was founded in October 2017 by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez with the goal of providing credit services to the cryptocurrency market. The company initially offered loans in U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies and later expanded into offering compound interest accounts. BlockFi raised significant funding through various funding rounds, including Series A, B, and C funding rounds. However, in 2020, the company faced a minor hack and invested heavily in Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, which later proved difficult to exit. In early 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust and raised $350 million, valuing the company at $3 billion. The company faced setbacks in July 2021 when several states issued cease and desist orders against BlockFi's interest accounts. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated the company, leading to a settlement of $100 million. In June 2022, BlockFi's valuation dropped to $1 billion, and the company faced further challenges when its major creditor, FTX, collapsed in November. This led to BlockFi filing for bankruptcy protection, leaving over 100,000 creditors unsure if they will recover their funds.",
