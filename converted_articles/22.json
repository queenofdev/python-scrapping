    "content": "Bitcoin surpassed the $37,000 mark early on Monday following the election of Javier Milei as the President of Argentina. Milei, a pro-bitcoin candidate, has been a vocal supporter of the cryptocurrency and its potential to decentralize money. In addition to Bitcoin's rise, the artificial intelligence (AI) token sector also experienced significant growth, increasing by over 8% due to unrelated developments in the rising AI industry. Although these positive factors contributed to the overall market performance, some traders have raised concerns about potential market reactions to the release of Federal Reserve meeting notes on Tuesday. Furthermore, the market is anticipated to experience low liquidity towards the end of the week as U.S. financial markets close for the Thanksgiving holiday. Overall, traders remain watchful of various events and announcements that could impact the cryptocurrency market in the coming days.",
