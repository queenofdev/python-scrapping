    "content": "Cryptocurrency prices experienced a decline on Monday, mirroring the slight decreases in global equity markets and the rise in oil prices due to renewed turmoil in the Middle East. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, saw a 1.7% drop over the past 24 hours, reaching $27,500. Despite this decline, Bitcoin outperformed most other digital assets, with Matrixport, a crypto investment services firm, highlighting it as \"better than digital gold.\" Bitcoin had shown signs of potentially surpassing a two-month high above $28,400 over the weekend but was unable to move past $28,200 before the influence of sellers took hold early this morning.\n\nThe broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) experienced a 2% decrease. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, suffered a 2.5% decline, potentially due to macroeconomic concerns. Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation sold $2.7 million worth of tokens on UniSwap, further impacting Ether's performance. This resulted in Ether reaching a fresh 15-month low against Bitcoin.\n\nOther altcoins also faced significant losses. Ripple Labs-adjacent token (XRP), solana (SOL), Polygon's native token (MATIC), Avalanche's (AVAX), and the popular meme token dogecoin (DOGE) all experienced declines of 4%-5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which entered its third day on Monday, has had an impact on the markets. Concerns about the conflict spreading to neighboring states, particularly Iran, have influenced oil prices, as traders speculate that it could disrupt supply. Josh Young, the chief investment officer of energy investment firm Bison Interests, explained that the imposition of sanctions on Iranian exports by the US could have a significant effect on the oil market. Young predicts a potential increase of around $5 for WTI crude oil if these sanctions are enforced. WTI crude oil has risen by nearly 3.5% since Sunday, reaching $86.54 per barrel, marking a three-month gain of 16%, according to MarketWatch data.\n\nEquity markets across Asia closed in the red, while European and US stocks also experienced moderate declines. The Stoxx 600, a broad European equity index, was down by just 0.25%, and the S&P 500 index in the US was down by 0.6%.\n\n(Edited by Parikshit Mishra and Stephen Alpher.)",
