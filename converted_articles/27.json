The price of bitcoin had surged by as much as 25% on the back of hopes for the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Other major tokens showed mixed movement during this time. Cardano's ADA slipped by 2%, while Solana's SOL tokens added 3%, extending their week-long rally to almost 30%. The growth in SOL tokens was driven by traders downplaying concerns about a potential sell-off by the FTX bankruptcy estate.\n\nThe CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks hundreds of tokens, rose by 0.42%, indicating modest gains across the overall market. Traders also noted that the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies may signal the end of the \"crypto winter,\" a term used to describe a bear market marked by low prices and minimal venture capital investments. Diogo M\u00f3nica, co-founder at Anchorage Digital, expressed optimism about the future, stating that institutional adoption is bringing the market closer to a perpetual spring. He believes that the recent price action and progress towards spot Bitcoin ETF approval have made the long-term outlook for Bitcoin the most promising it has been in recent memory.\n\nQCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, highlighted the significant demand for bitcoin driven by the anticipation of a spot ETF approval. They suggested that recent steps taken by Blackrock, such as a DTCC listing and tickerization, have given the market hope for imminent SEC approval. However, they do not believe that this indicates an immediate decision from the SEC in the coming week. Instead, they anticipate that the SEC will stick to its previous precedent and approve multiple managers at the same time, avoiding the role of \"kingmaker.\"\n\nThe paragraph has been converted to meet the criteria of under 100 lines while maintaining the same meaning.",
