    "content": "Orbit Markets and PI Digital are introducing a unique derivative product that focuses on a combination of bitcoin and gold. This product aims to offer investors exposure to both digital assets and gold, which are known for their value stability. The derivative, called XAUT, is a gold-backed token issued by Tether and will be settled in either USDT, XAUT, or bitcoin at maturity. This initiative comes as investors seek steady returns in times of economic uncertainty, particularly due to concerns over the US central bank's monetary policy and the banking sector's instability. It allows investors to express different views and potentially earn enhanced yields based on the performance of both BTC and XAUT. If both assets appreciate, investors can earn an enhanced yield, while the worst performer will determine investors' outcome if either asset falls. OrBit Markets has previously used options contracts to hedge liquidity providers' positions and prevent losses in Uniswap liquidity pools. They plan to launch more hybrid products specifically targeting institutional investors. Orbit Markets views this hybrid asset product as suitable for investors experienced in traditional assets like gold who want to venture into digital assets.",
