Bullish sentiment was dampened as more than $100 million in futures positions were liquidated and the market experienced an average decline of 2%. Bitcoin (BTC) displayed relative stability compared to other cryptocurrencies, with a 1% loss over the past 24 hours and maintaining a position above the key support level of $27,500 during Asian morning hours on Tuesday. Traders are closely monitoring assets like technology stocks and bitcoin due to rising oil prices. Analysts at trading firm FxPro have suggested that a break of the $28,000 level for bitcoin could turn the market bullish. However, the cryptocurrency faced resistance at its 200-day moving average over the weekend. The focus is now on whether BTCUSD can consolidate above $28,000, as this may result in a quick rise to around $29,500. In other news, ether experienced a 3% decline following the Ethereum Foundation's sale of $2.7 million worth of tokens on Monday, which caused concerns among traders. This also impacted the ETH futures markets, leading to losses of over $30 million for ether bulls, the highest among all crypto traders on Monday. Other cryptocurrencies such as Solana's SOL tokens, XRP, and Cardano's ADA also saw declines, with respective losses of nearly 5%, 3.7%, and 3.4%. The overall crypto market sentiment was negative, as indicated by the 1.9% decline of the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks numerous tokens.",
