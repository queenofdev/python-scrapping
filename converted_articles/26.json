    "content": "Tokens based on the Bitcoin blockchain are becoming increasingly popular among market participants following a surge in the price of bitcoin. The BRC-20 category of tokens has seen a 21% increase in the past 24 hours, with tokens such as TRAC, MEME, and NALS leading the way with significant gains. Introduced in April, the BRC-20 standard allows users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time. These tokens, known as inscriptions, are embedded into the Bitcoin blockchain using the Ordinals Protocol. The recent listing of ORDI on Binance has contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding BRC-20 tokens, with traders speculating on the potential profits within the Bitcoin token ecosystem. As of Thursday, there are over 37,000 BRC-20 tokens in existence. In addition, social applications built on Bitcoin are incorporating in-game tokens to attract new users and increase revenues. Alpha, a decentralized app, now allows users to offer their own tokens for participation in community games and lotteries. The developers behind Alpha believe that there is still potential for wealthy bitcoin holders to utilize their assets within interactive applications.",
