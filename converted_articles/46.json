    "content": "KyberSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), has fallen victim to a theft amounting to almost $50 million. In response, the administrators are urging users to withdraw all their funds as a precautionary measure. The attacker has primarily targeted funds in Ether, wrapped ether (wETH), and USDC, stealing sizable amounts from cross-chain deployments of KyberSwap. These include $20 million from Arbitrum, $15 million from Optimism, and $7 million from Ethereum. Analysts investigating the incident have determined that this is not a result of a bug in the DEX's approval authorization code. Instead, it appears to be a deliberate attack specifically targeting the liquidity provider pools. The attacker has indicated that negotiations will commence shortly, once they have had adequate rest. They have also made a reference to Ontario, hinting at potential knowledge of their victims' location. This method of teasing victims by including text strings in signed transactions is a recurring phenomenon in decentralized finance hacks. As a consequence of the attack, KyberSwap's total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $22.23 million, a significant decrease from its previous value of around $80 million.",
