    "content": "Fed Governor Chris Waller, speaking in Washington, D.C., stated that recent data indicating a slowdown in the economy and ongoing moderation in inflation signifies appropriate U.S. Federal Reserve policy. Waller highlighted a noticeable deceleration in the pace of economic activity, citing October data and forecasts for the fourth quarter. He also noted that inflation data is moving favorably.\n\nDuring the Q&A session, Waller highlighted the potential for rate cuts in the coming months if a decline in inflation continues. It's worth mentioning that Waller is considered the third-most hawkish member of the Federal Open Market Committee, making any dovish tendencies from him noteworthy.\n\nAs a result of Waller's comments, bitcoin experienced a surge of more than 1% in value. In contrast, Michelle Bowman, Waller's colleague, expressed a different view at another event, suggesting that rates may need to rise to control inflation. At the time of writing, bitcoin was being traded at $37,700.\n\nTraditional markets also reacted to Waller's remarks, with the 10-year Treasury yield dropping four basis points to 4.35%. The dollar index declined by 0.4%, while gold experienced a 1.3% increase to reach $2,038 per ounce.",
