Originally based in China, the company had to relocate from Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions soon after its launch.\n\nBinance has developed its own blockchain known as Binance Smart Chain, which was later renamed BNB Chain. This blockchain facilitates trading on the Binance exchange. Binance coin (BNB) is the native token of this blockchain, and the company has also introduced a stablecoin called BinanceUSD (BUSD). To cater to its U.S. clients and comply with regulatory rules, Binance created a separate entity called Binance.US in 2019.\n\nIn June 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), accusing them of offering unregistered securities, namely BNB and BUSD, to the public. This lawsuit raises questions about the independence of Binance's U.S. arm and its staking service.\n\nThis is not the first time Binance has faced regulatory scrutiny in the United States. In March 2023, the company and CZ were sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly offering unregistered crypto derivatives products.\n\nCZ, also known as Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, is the founder of Binance. He is a prominent figure in the crypto community, actively engaging with users and participating in events. CZ was born in China and became a Canadian citizen after immigrating to Canada at the age of 12. Before starting Binance, he worked in various roles, including developing software for financial institutions.\n\nBinance and Binance.US are two separate entities. Binance was originally founded in Shanghai but has no fixed headquarters, according to CZ. It offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies for trading, over 500, while Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies but is not available in all U.S. states. Binance.com supports margin trading and futures contracts, whereas Binance.US does not.\n\nOver the years, Binance has encountered significant events and developments. These include acquiring Trust Wallet, launching a decentralized exchange (DEX), migrating BNB to its proprietary chain, getting hacked, launching Binance.US, buying CoinMarketCap, introducing the BUSD stablecoin, and experiencing leadership changes.\n\nBinance and CZ have been subject to legal actions, controversies, and rumors. The recent SEC charges against Binance.US and CZ, the termination of the Voyager Digital asset purchase deal, and the alleged Interpol \"Red Notice\" for CZ are some examples.\n\nIt is important to note that this rewritten paragraph may contain factual errors or incomplete information compared to the original paragraph.",
