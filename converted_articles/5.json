    "content": "Binance's founder and former CEO, Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao, will be stepping down from his position as chairman of the board of Binance's U.S. affiliate. In a tweet, Binance.US announced that although it was not involved in the recent multibillion-dollar settlement between Binance and U.S. regulators and law enforcement, Zhao will transfer his voting rights to a proxy. As CZ transitions to life after Binance, he has decided to resign as Chairman of the Board, and his involvement in the company's governance will be purely economic. Binance was accused of operating in the U.S. without proper registration, allowing U.S. crypto investors to transact with customers in sanctioned regions. As part of the settlement, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion, exit the U.S. market completely, and accept Zhao's resignation as CEO. Binance.US, on the other hand, is a registered business and was not part of the settlement. However, it is currently facing a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action for offering unregistered securities to U.S. investors. Norman Reed and the existing management team will continue leading Binance.US with renewed clarity and momentum while maintaining a strong commitment to customers.",
