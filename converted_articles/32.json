    "content": "Several traders who spoke to CoinDesk believe that the war in the Middle East could have an impact on the crypto markets, potentially causing a short-term decline in assets like bitcoin (BTC). The conflict, which entered its fourth day on Tuesday with Hamas' attack on Israeli towns, has resulted in a death toll of around 1,600 on both sides. Greta Yuan, head of research at digital assets platform VDX, noted that investors are concerned about the conflict spreading to oil-producing countries, leading to a rise in market risk-averse sentiment and an increase in the price of spot gold.\n\nOn Monday, crypto markets experienced a 2% slump as traders took into account rising oil prices and a decrease in traditional equities, given the potential impact of the turmoil on international trade. Futures traders anticipated higher prices but saw over $100 million in liquidations within a 24-hour period, leading to a sell-off in alternative currencies. However, despite the initial dip, crypto markets are displaying signs of resilience, which could boost investor confidence. Jeff Mei, COO of crypto exchange BTSE, pointed out that crypto assets have previously shown resilience in the face of geopolitical turmoil.\n\nIn early 2022, tensions between Russia and Ukraine resulted in a 7% drop in bitcoin in a single day, highlighting the significant impact of geopolitical conflicts on the crypto market. During such times, investors tend to flock to gold while riskier assets often experience declines. Some traders suggest that observing changes in the oil and energy markets could provide insights into the future direction of bitcoin.\n\nAlex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, mentioned that if the risks of expansion and conflict escalation materialize, it is important to monitor energy prices. Rising oil prices can lead to sell-offs in equities and expectations of tighter monetary policy, posing a considerable risk to assets like bitcoin and the overall crypto market. However, if a quick return to normalcy occurs, it could have a positive impact on cryptocurrencies. For now, it seems that the chances of a decrease in appetite for equities and cryptocurrencies are higher compared to previous weeks, according to Kuptsikevich.",
