    "content": "Binance and its founder, Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, have faced backlash in the U.S. due to the perceived threat posed by centralized exchanges like Binance to the traditional American-led global financial system, according to former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. In an essay published on his Substack account, Hayes argued that the recent criminal charges and fines imposed on Binance and CZ highlight the arbitrary nature of punishment by the state. Hayes drew comparisons to other financial institutions, like Goldman Sachs, whose CEOs faced less severe consequences for their involvement in major scandals. Hayes suggested that the treatment of Binance and CZ reflects resistance against decentralization and the blockchain revolution, which challenge the power of the state. Hayes, who himself faced prosecution for violating the Bank Secrecy Act, argued that the establishment views intermediaries in the blockchain industry as a threat to their centralized control.",
