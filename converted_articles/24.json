One particular token experienced a staggering 6,600% surge in September, even before being listed on international exchanges. However, despite these surges in altcoins, bitcoin has maintained its dominance in the market since September. The surge in alternative cryptocurrencies can partly be attributed to the high-risk behavior of South Korean traders, who often incite speculative frenzies in various tokens. Local exchange Upbit saw a significant increase in spot volumes, nearly doubling since September. Upbit accounted for over 85% of Korean trading volume, with an 82% growth in October compared to the previous month. This rise in volumes attracted market makers and traders, who reinvested their profits into the rising market. Notable increases in prices were seen with tokens like Loom Network's LOOM and HIFI, which experienced significant surges. South Korea plays a pivotal role in these altcoin rallies, as evident from the rise in HIFI reserves on Upbit. However, while altcoin activity has flourished on South Korean exchanges, bitcoin has maintained its dominant position in the global market. Bitcoin's market dominance rose from 49% to 53% during this period, suggesting that it remained the preferred choice among traders. Overall market capitalization has also increased from $1 trillion to $1.4 trillion.",
