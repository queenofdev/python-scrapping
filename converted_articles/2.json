    "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes that the cryptocurrency industry can finally put an end to the era of bad actors, following the recent settlement between Binance and the U.S. Department of Justice. In an interview with CNBC International at the Global Investment Summit in London, Armstrong stated that the enforcement action against Binance provides an opportunity to turn the page on this negative aspect of crypto's history. He emphasized that the criminal actions against Binance and FTX, another bankrupt crypto exchange, confirm that operating offshore is not a viable strategy. Armstrong asserted that although skirting the rules may lead to fast growth initially, the consequences will eventually catch up. He argued that it is time for U.S.-based companies that have adhered to regulations from the beginning to flourish. While Coinbase also faces regulatory challenges in the U.S., specifically allegations of operating unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agencies simultaneously, Armstrong expressed confidence in the outcome of the case, indicating that it will contribute to regulatory clarity. Despite its efforts to expand into other jurisdictions, Coinbase remains dedicated to its U.S. business, which Armstrong considers its second-largest market. He acknowledged the significance of launching a spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), describing it as a monumental development that will attract new sources of capital to the industry and establish legitimacy.",
