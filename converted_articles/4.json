    "content": "According to Standard Chartered Bank, they have reiterated their previous prediction that bitcoin (BTC) will reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. A team from the bank, including Geoff Kendrick, stated that the approvals of U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs will be the next catalyst, and they believe these approvals will come sooner than anticipated. They anticipate that in Q1-2024, a number of spot ETFs for both BTC and ETH will be approved, which will pave the way for institutional investment. The team also highlighted that the upcoming Bitcoin 'halving' expected to occur in late April 2024 will contribute to the potential price increase. Standard Chartered originally made their $100,000 forecast in April, stating that bitcoin's status as a branded safe haven had been beneficial. The bank expressed confidence in their prediction, noting that BTC's dominance in the overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50% from 45% since April. Additionally, they believe there is a possibility that the cryptocurrency could reach the $100,000 milestone before the end of this year due to the earlier-than-expected introduction of U.S. spot ETFs.",
