During the European morning hours on Tuesday, BTC traded slightly above $37,500, registering a 0.6% increase. On the other hand, Ether (ETH) experienced a 0.5% loss, while dogecoin (DOGE) and solana (SOL) both declined by as much as 5%, potentially due to profit-taking by traders. BNB Chain's (BNB) tokens, on the other hand, saw an increase of up to 8% in value amid reports that Binance, the exchange that initially issued these tokens, may soon reach a $4 billion settlement for multiple criminal charges in the United States.\n\nThe anticipation among some traders is that bitcoin will remain range-bound in the coming weeks, as its recent surge faces headwinds due to uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve's next steps and delays in a crucial regulatory decision regarding ETFs. Analysts at the Japanese exchange bitbank, led by Yukari Kusu, noted that the $38,000 psychological level has acted as a resistance, preventing bitcoin from breaking through. One of the contributing factors for this was the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to postpone its ruling on Hasdex's bitcoin ETF. This decision had significant impact because it influenced market expectations and trading activities.\n\nIn another perspective, analysts from crypto exchange Bitfinex mentioned in a Tuesday note that they anticipated the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates at the December meeting. They stated that headline inflation had declined considerably from 6.4% at the beginning of the year, providing the Federal Reserve with enough flexibility to keep rates steady. This aligns with the current market expectations reflected in the Fed Futures market and supports the central bank's objective of sustaining economic expansion. However, the note also emphasized that this pause in rate hikes should not be misconstrued as a shift in the Federal Reserve's overall tightening policy, as the central bank remains cautious and ready to adjust rates if inflation persists or unexpectedly rises.\n\nIt is important to note that interest rate decisions have a significant impact on the markets. Higher interest rates often result in risk assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, facing downward pressure as investors may choose to secure profits and shift investments to bonds.\n\n-Edited by Oliver Knight.",
