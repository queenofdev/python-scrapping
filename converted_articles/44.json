    "content": "Cathie Wood's ARK Invest liquidated approximately $5.26 million worth of shares in Coinbase (COIN) on Monday, coinciding with the crypto exchange's surge to a 19-month high at closing. The transaction, which involved 43,956 shares, marked the largest sale since July 25. However, during that previous sale, the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF disposed of over 53,000 COIN shares at a lower price, resulting in a lower overall value. Additionally, the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF purchased 143,063 shares of Robinhood (HOOD) for a total of $1.2 million at the closing price. This acquisition represents ARK Invest's fifth purchase of HOOD shares this month. As typical investing behavior, ARK Invest tends to accumulate crypto-related stocks while they are in a downtrend and then offload them when they appear more optimistic, thereby capitalizing on potential profits.
