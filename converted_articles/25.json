    "content": "The crypto market experienced a surge, leading to a 4.6% increase in overall capitalization within the last 24 hours. This brought the total to $1.44 trillion, a level not seen since May 2022. Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins returned to their previous highs, essentially reversing the losses incurred from a $300 million liquidation event on Tuesday. Among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, Cardano's ADA and dogecoin (DOGE) recorded the highest gains, with an increase of up to 12%, even without any immediate catalysts. The liquidations on futures related to these major coins were lower than usual, indicating that the rise in prices was primarily driven by spot buying. The CoinDesk Market Index, which provides a market capitalization-weighted measure of the digital asset market, rose by 3.8%. Solana's SOL also experienced a significant climb, reaching as high as $67. This ascent continued for a week, partly due to positive sentiment surrounding the blockchain and diminishing concerns regarding an upcoming FTX sale of the token, which would introduce more SOL into the market. Avalanche's AVAX witnessed a jump of 24% after the announcement that developer Ava Labs was collaborating with banking giant JPMorgan on a portfolio management product to be offered in Singapore. Market analysts pointed out that the gains in the crypto market mirrored those of traditional assets like stocks, despite recent movements suggesting initial signs of decoupling. FxPro markets analyst Alex Kuptsikevich noted that the dynamics of both markets seemed to diverge, but maintained that this negative correlation was only temporary, as both asset classes had been steadily rising since October. Kuptsikevich also mentioned that bitcoin bulls remained strong, as the price tested the $38,000 level once again, potentially paving the way for $46,000.",
