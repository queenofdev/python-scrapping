Instead, they lend out a majority of your deposits in order to generate returns from the financial markets. This system has generally been successful because these banks are insured by the federal government and also diversify their risk exposure to prevent being caught off guard in the event of a financial crisis.\n\nHowever, this system tends to fail more frequently in the world of cryptocurrencies compared to traditional finance. Unlike traditional banks, crypto platforms are not insured by the government, and they often do a poor job of managing risk. They engage in high-risk bets that sometimes result in catastrophic losses, as seen with platforms like FTX, Voyager Digital, and Celsius Network.\n\nAs a result of these platforms squandering customer funds, crypto traders are becoming hesitant about depositing their funds in crypto exchanges and lending institutions that \"rehypothecate\" uninsured deposits. This means these platforms repurpose customer money and lend it out in the markets. Instead, traders are looking for safer alternatives, such as trading on platforms that \"fully back\" their reserves. But what does it mean for a platform to be \"fully backed,\" and should we trust such claims?\n\nWhen a financial product, like a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to be \"fully backed\" by its reserves, it means that it has enough money stored behind that product to support its value. This ensures that a crypto exchange, for example, should always have enough funds available to honor customer withdrawals, regardless of market conditions. Coinbase is an example of an exchange that does not lend out customer funds without permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to avoid a bank run.\n\nA stablecoin that is \"fully backed\" guarantees that it can always fulfill conversions to the original asset. For instance, wBTC (wrapped bitcoin) holds real bitcoin in cold storage and issues an equivalent amount of Ethereum-based tokens that can be traded as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that being \"fully backed\" doesn't necessarily mean that assets are held on a one-to-one basis. Some stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like USDC (U.S. dollar stablecoin), are not backed on a one-to-one basis. Instead, these companies hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in \"cash and cash equivalents,\" which include U.S. Treasury bonds. Although these bonds pay small returns, they are considered close enough to the value of U.S. dollars.\n\nFurthermore, being \"fully backed\" doesn't guarantee protection against financial shocks. The stablecoin tether (USDT) claims to be fully backed, but its backing is secured by \"other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties.\" This means that while USDT may be fully backed, it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies. In the past, USDT was also backed by commercial paper, which raised concerns about the transparency and reliability of its backing.\n\nSome stablecoins have experienced catastrophic results due to not fully backing their reserves. An example is the algorithmic stablecoin UST, which crashed and caused billions in losses. On the other hand, the U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, ensuring it has more than enough crypto to back its coin. DAI has successfully weathered several market crashes.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of being \"fully backed\" varies depending on the financial product or institution. It's crucial to understand the specific mechanisms of backing and assess the risks involved before trusting claims of being fully backed.",
