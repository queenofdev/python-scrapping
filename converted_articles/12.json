    "content": "Following his guilty plea to U.S. criminal charges and resignation as CEO of Binance, the former CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange is already making plans for his future in the crypto industry. Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), shared that he does not intend to completely leave the crypto space. Instead, he plans to engage in passive investing, becoming a minority token/shareholder in blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI, and biotech start-ups. Additionally, CZ expressed his excitement to have more time to devote to exploring DeFi.\n\nHe also mentioned that he does not foresee becoming the CEO of another start-up, but he remains open to acting as a coach or mentor for a select group of emerging entrepreneurs privately. CZ emphasized that he will continue to hold shares in Binance and will be available for consultation if required.\n\nCZ, the founder of Binance in 2017, has been succeeded by Richard Teng, who previously oversaw the exchange's business operations outside of the United States.",
